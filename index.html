            <h2>SMASH ULTIMATE</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my Smash Ultimate Mains page! For those who don't know, Super Smash Bros is one of 
                the greatest Nintendo games of all time. Running 1s, doubles, etc is a blast. Here are my mains:
            </p>
            <h2>GANONDORF</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w1KUR9oI5dg?si=RPcHL7MAvIgD6tUz" title="YouTube video player" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>Ganondorf does an insane amount of damage and is always fun to play. He's slow as hell, but that makes it so much more satisfying
                when you time his hits right and time the spike right. The spike is always the most satisfying part of playing him. Also, people
                underestimate the amount of damage they already have very often, which makes it a fun surprise when you land a regular hit on them 
                and it ends up launching them.

            <h2>CLOUD</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/reUh1uV_Kdo?si=YAckYEBRBqv53yB7" title="YouTube video player" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>Okay I get it, Cloud, basic right? But if it ain't broke don't fix it! Or just stop telling Nintendo to fix it and let me main Cloud!
                Cloud's movements are fluid, he's fast, strong, and his combos are super entertaining. Cloud is amazing, and you should have no shame in maining him.

            <h2>LITTLE MAC</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qJ6hANLlYt8?si=q77_GfjTgeOSKXf9" title="YouTube video player" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>I don't remember when I started maining Little Mac or if I did it as a joke, and then he grew on me. His biggest weakness is that he can't cover 
                horizontally. He can spin up, but then you'll start falling down. So to beat Little Mac, you just have to throw him off the edge and defend it. 
                Regardless, beating someone with Little Mac is so satisfying since he's often looked as the worse character of smash and the embarassment you can 
                churn is amazing.
